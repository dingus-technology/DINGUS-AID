## Quick Setup

Make sure you have docker installed.

1. **Create directories**
   ```bash
   mkdir output logs
   ```
2. **Build the Binary**
   - Let's set up the Dingus CLI tool by building the Docker image:
     ```bash
     ./dingus-copilot-installer.sh
     ```
     or
     ```bash
     bash dingus-copilot-installer.sh
     ```

3. **Install the Tool**
   - The `dingus-copilot` binary will be placed in `/usr/local/bin`, ready for use from anywhere in your terminal.

4. **Configure Your API Key**
   - When you run the tool for the first time, you'll need to enter your OpenAI API key. Don't worry, it'll be saved in the `config.json` file for later and easy to remove if you need to wipe it from your machine üîë.

5. **Start Using It**
   - Set API key:
     ```bash
     dingus-copilot hi
     Enter your OpenAI API Key: <YOUR OPENAI API KEY HERE>
     ```
   - To ask Dingus Aid a question, just run:
     ```
     dingus-copilot How do I list files in a directory?
     ```
   - Dingus Aid will suggest the correct command and ask if you want to run it. Simple as that!
